# FreqSal
## Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409) 
- **April 29, 2024**  
  The paper is undergoing peer review. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

- In this project, we proposed the deep Fourier-embedded network, namely FreqSal, a purely Fourier-based model aimed at solving the high-resolution bi-modal inputs and feature fusion while minimizing memory consumption of GPU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art bi-modal salient object detection (BSOD) models on four RGB-T BSOD benchmark datasets. **To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Fourier-based supervised model in a series of salient object detection tasks.**
